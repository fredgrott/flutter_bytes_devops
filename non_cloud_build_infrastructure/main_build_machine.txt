Two ways to do this:

1. Laptop and Nuc combo

   a. Choose Apple Laptop with enough graphics cores to drive
      3 remote screens and enough ram and SSD

   b. NUCs for non Apple and non android devices will 
      be either Intel Iris or Intel Arc graphics
       with enough ram and SSD storage to handle the builds.

2. Without NUCs, Apple studio

   Qemu is the only emulator that can 
   emulate graphics via software without
   relying upon Host OS. That means
   it will  be slower unless you get high 
   enough CPU and GPU cores.

   Note: The Androiod Emulator is a Qemu
   variation for this reason of needing to 
   emulate graphics through software without
   relying upon the host OS as they host OS
   hypervisor is handling memory.

   Hence you need the highest CPU and GPU 
   cores you can afford with Apple Studio
   such as

   Apple M2Max with !2-core CPU,
   38-core GPU and 16-core
   Neural Engine and 64 gig ram or higher

   With 4TB SSD to account for 
   Qemu running separate OSes
