# Flutter Bytes: DevOPS

This is core of devOPS that you need to use to develop flutter apps. At some point later, I will add the CI set up and some git basics.

This is part of my approach towards a full Flutter and Dart
book series with the flutter bytes hub listing all the
code repos and articles at:
